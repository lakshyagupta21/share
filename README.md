## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 About Share

Share is an Android application which is a companion app to ODK Collect and it helps different enumerators to share the filled and blanks forms with each other, it also helps organization’s supervisor in reviewing the forms before actually submitting to the server. 

### 1.2 Why Share


Share is designed to enable offline transfer of blank and filled forms. There are three major use cases for this multi-part surveys, supervisor review and blank form distribution.
ODK Collect is designed in such a way that it allows enumerators to download the blank forms and provide them with the interface to fill the blank forms, but sometimes there can be more than one enumerators who want to fill the same form. Collect doesn’t allow more than one enumerators to collaborate on a single form. This is where Share comes into the picture using Share one can select any number of forms and can send to the other enumerator will all the resources attached to it.

Also, sometimes organizations want to review filled forms before sending to the server. So enumerators can send the forms to the supervisor then the supervisor can mark forms as reviewed (accepted/rejected) with some feedback and then can send back to the same enumerator if required.

In some areas, enumerators don’t have any internet connectivity, so they can’t fetch blank forms from the server. Share also allows to send a blank form in case of no internet connectivity provided the devices should be close enough to create a local connection.
